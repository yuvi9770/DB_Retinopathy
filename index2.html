        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. 
        Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent vision loss. With the advancements 
        in image processing and machine learning techniques, automated systems for the detection 
        of diabetic retinopathy have gained significant attention. This review provides an overview 
        of recent developments in DR detection methods, focusing on image processing, feature extraction, 
        and classification algorithms. Various imaging modalities such as fundus photography and optical 
        coherence tomography are discussed along with their advantages and limitations. Additionally, 
        deep learning approaches, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their variants, 
        are explored for their effectiveness in DR detection. The review also addresses challenges such as 
        dataset imbalance, interpretability of deep learning models, and generalization to diverse populations. 
        Lastly, future directions and potential research avenues for improving the accuracy and reliability of 
        automated DR detection systems are discussed. Overall, this review serves as a comprehensive guide for 
        researchers and practitioners in the field of diabetic retinopathy detection, aiming to facilitate the 
        development of robust and efficient screening tools for early diagnosis and management of this sight-threatening 
        complication of diabetes.</p>
